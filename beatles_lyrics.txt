A Day In The Life
-----------------
I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights have changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on.
Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged my comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my way coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on.

A world without love
-----------------
Please lock me away,
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
Birds sing out of tune
And rainclouds hide the moon.
I’m okay, here I’ll stay with my loneliness
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
So I wait and in a while,
I will see my true love smile.
She may come, I know not when,
When she does I’ll know.
So baby, until then, lock me away,
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
So I wait and in a while,
I will see my true love smile.
She may come, I know not when,
When she does I’ll know.
So baby, until then, lock me away,
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.

Across The Universe
-----------------
Words are flying out like endless rain into a papercup,
They slither while, they pass, they slip away across the
univer-se
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing and caressing me.
Jai Guru De va Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.
Jai Guru De va Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing through my open views inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, it calls me on and on across the universe.
Jai Guru De va Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai Guru De va Om...

Act Naturally
-----------------
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta so is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can plat the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can plat the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

And Your Bird Can Sing
-----------------
You tell me that you've got everything you want
and your bird can sing but you don't get me
You don't get me
When you prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction I'll be round - I'll be round
You say you've seen seven wonders
and your bird is green but you can't see me
You can't me
When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken I'll be round - I'll be round
Tell me that you've heard ev'ry sound there is
And your bird can swing but you can't hear me
You can't hear me.

Angela
-----------------
Angela, they put you in
prison
Angela, they shot down
your man
Angela, you`re one of the
millions of political
prisioners in the world.
Sister, there´s wind that
never dies
Sister, we´re breathing
together
Sister, our loves and hopes
forever keep
on moving oh so slowly
in the world.
Angela, can you hear the
earth is turning?
Angela, the world
watches you.
Angela, you soon will be
returning to your sisters and
brothers of the world.
Sister, you`re still a people
teacher
Sister, your word reaches far
Sister, there`s a million
different races but we all
share the same future
in the world.
They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but
the jailhouse key.
They gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything
but equality.

Another Girl
-----------------
For I have got Another Girl
Another girl you're naking me say
that I've got nobody but you
But as from today well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got Another Girl,
Another girl she's sweeter than all the girls
and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do

For I have got Another Girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you

Attica State
-----------------
Lennon & Yoko Ono
What a waste of human
power
What a waste of human lives,
shoot the prisioners in
the towers
Forthy-three poor widowed
wives
Media blames it on the
prisioners,
But the prisioners did not kill
"Rockefeller pulled the trigger"
That’s what the people feel.
Attica, Attica state, we’re all
mates with Attica state.
Free the prisioners, free
the judges
Free all the prisioners everywhere,
All they want is truth
and justice
All they need is love and care
They all live in suffocation,
Let’s not wathc them die
in sorrow,
Now’s the time for revolution,
Give them all chance to grow.
Attica state......
Come together join the movement,
Take a stand for human rights,
Fear and hatred clouds
our judgement,
Free us all from endless
night,
Attica state....
We are all mattes...
We all live in......
Attica, Attica, Attica state.

Baby You're A Rich Man
-----------------
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are what do you want to be
And have you traveled very far, far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
How often have you been there often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E happy to be that way
No that you've found another key what are you going to play
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too...

Back In The USSR
-----------------
Flew in from Miami Beach, B.O.A.C.
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the USSR.
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee - it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the US.. - Back in the US..
Back in the USSR.
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Ooh - Come on
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the USSR.
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Ooh
Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrad warm
I'm back in the USSR - Hey
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the USSR.
Oh - yeah

Bad Boy
-----------------
A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girl's hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Bad To Me
-----------------
If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be
Sad and lonely if they knew that
I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be
Softly sighin' if they heard from the breeze that you
Left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so,
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be
Sad and lonely 'cos they know that
I got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so,
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be
Sad and lonely 'cos they know that
I got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me

Badge
-----------------
Thinking 'bout the times you drove in my car,
Thinking that I might have drove it too far.
And I’m thinking 'bout the love that you laid on my table.
I told you not to wander 'round in the dark,
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park.
Then I told you 'bout "our kid", now he's married to mabel.
Yes, I told you that the life goes up and down,
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.
Oo - oo -
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Talking 'bout a girl that looks quite like you,
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.

Close your eyes,
Have no fear,
The monsters gone,
He's on the run and your daddy's here,
Beautiful,

Before you go to sleep,
Say a little prayer,
Every day in every way,

To see you to come of age,
But I guess we'll both,
Just have to be patient,

But in the meantime,
Before you cross the street,
Take my hand,
Life is just what happens to you,
While your busy making other plans,

You're a beautiful boy,

Your eyes have seen the world,
Though your only four years old,
And your tears are streaming,
Even when your smiling,
Please never be afraid to cry,
You're a beautiful boy,
With all your little ploys,
Your mind has changed the world,
And your now forty years old,
You got all you can carry,
And still somehow empty,
Don't ever be afraid to fly,
All you beautiful boys,
Creating multiple plays,
You like to fence in your world,
And settle down when you're old,
You can run from pole to pole,
And never scratch your soul,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to be afraid.

Because

Ah Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Ah love is old love is new
love is all love is you
Because the sky is blue it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue
Ah ah ah ah

Born in a Prision
-----------------
We are born in a prision,
raised in a prision
Send to a prision called school,
We cry in a prision,
We love in a prision,
We live in a prision,
like fools.
Wood becomes a flut when
it’s loved,
reach for your self and your
battered mates.
Mirror becomes a razor when
it’s broken,
Look in a mirror and see
your shattered fate.
We live with no reason,
Kicked around for no reason,
Thrown out without reason
like tools.
Work in a prision
And hate in aprision
And die in a prision
as a rule.
We live in a prision
Among judges and wardnes
And wait for no reason or use
We laugh in a prision,
Go through all four seasons
And die with no vision
or truth

Carol
-----------------
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day.
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out.
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout.
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride.
You take your car along
And you park it outside.
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am,
'Cos every time you're gonna drive,
You find the joint is jammed.
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day. Aw.
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play,
Hold tight, tap your foot,
Don't let it carry you away.
Don't let the heat overcome you
'Cos they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd.
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought.
I got my eyes on you baby,
'Cos you dance so good.

Cleanup Time
-----------------
Moonlight on the water,
Sun light on my face,
You and me together,
We are in our place,
The gods are in the heavens,
The angels treat us well,
The oracle has spoken,
We cast the (perfect) spell,
Now it begins - let it begin,
Cleanup Time,
(Show those mothers how to do it),
The queen is in the counting home,
Counting out the money,
The king is in the kitchen,
Making bread and honey,
No friends and yet no enemies,
Absolutely free,
No rats aboard the magic ship,
Of (perfect) harmony,
Now it begins,
Cleanup Time,
(Show those mothers how to do it),
However, far we travel,
Wherever we may roam,
The centre of the circle,
Will always be our home,
The gods are in the heavens,
The angels treat us well,
The oracle has spoken,
We cast the (perfect) spell.

Cold Turkey

Body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone.
My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm at the deep freeze.
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Thirty six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again
Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell
Cold turkey has got me on the run

And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving darling, I be true
All my loving
All my loving
All my loving I will send to you

Don't Bother Me
-----------------
Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same,
But I am to blame,
It's plain to see
So go away - leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe
That she would leave me on my own
It's just not right when ev'ry night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

Little Child

Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
Little child - Little child
Little child won't you dance with me

If you want someone to make you feel so fine,
Then we'll have some fun
When you're mine, all mine
So come on, come on, come on
Little child - Little child
Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
When you're by my side you're the only one
Don't you run and hide

Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
Oh yeh - Baby take a chance with me

Till There was You
-----------------
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you

Roll Over Beethoven
-----------------
Well I'm awrite a little letter, gonna mail it to my local D.J.,
Yes it's a jumpin' little record I want my jockey to play;
Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today.
You know my temp'rature's risin' and the jukebox blowin' a fuse,
My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps asingin' the blues;
Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikowsky the news.
I got the rockin' pneumonia, I used a shot of rhythm and blues,
I caught the rollin' arthritis, sittin' down at a rhythm review;
Roll over Beethoven, they're rockin' in two by two.
Well, if you feel you like it, go get your lover,
The reel and rock it, roll it over,
Then move on up just a trifle further,
The reel and rock with one another, roll over Beethoven,
Dig these rhythm and blues.
Well, early in the mornin' and I'm givin' you my warnin',
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes;
Hey, diddle diddle, I'm a playin' my fiddle.
Ain't got nothin' to lose;
Roll over, Beethoven and tell Tchaikowsky the news.
You know she wiggles like a glow-worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top,
She got a crazy partner,
You oughta see 'em reel and rock;
Long as she's got a dime, the music won't ever stop.
Roll over, Beethoven, roll over Beethoven,
Roll over, Beethoven, roll over Beethoven,
Roll over, Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues.

Eleanor Rigby
-----------------
Ah, Look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church
Where a wedding has been Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door. Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from
All the lonely people, where do they all belong
Father Mckenzie, writing the words of a sermon
that no-one will hear No-one comes near.
Look at him working, darning his stocks in the night when
the-re's nobody there. What does he care?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from
All the lonely people, where do they all belong
Ah, Look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
and was buried a long with her name Nobody came.
Father Mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands
as he walks from the grave. No one was saved.
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
(Ah - Look at all the lonely people)
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
(Ah - Look at all the lonely people)

Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him
-----------------
Every man has a woman who loves him,
In rain or shine or life and death,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast,
Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I laugh when I feel like crying,
Every woman has a man who loves her,
Rise or fall of her life and death,
If she finds him in this life time,
She will know when she looks into his eyes,
Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I run when I feel like holding you,
Every man has a woman who loves him,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know.

Fixing A Hole
-----------------
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the craks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

For No One
-----------------
Your day breaks Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
when she no longer needs you
She wakes up She makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you.
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
cried For No One
A love that should have lasted years.
You want her You need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says
her love is dead you think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
cried For No One
A love that should have lasted years.
You stay home She goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
she doesn't need him
Your day breaks Your mind aches
There will be times when all the things you said
will fill your head you won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
cried For No One
A love that should have lasted years.

For You Blue
-----------------
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do.
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living ev'ry moment, girl, for you.
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too.
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do.

From A Window
-----------------
Late yesterday night I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again your face came into sight.
I couldn't walk on until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine I knew you were the one.
Oh I would be glad just to have a love like that
Oh I would be true and I'd live my life for you
So meet me tonight just where the light shines from a window
And as I take your hand say you'll be mine tonight.
Oh I would be glad just to have a love like that
Oh I would be true and I'd live my life for you
So meet me tonight just where the light shines from a window
And as I take your hand say you'll be mine tonight.

Getting Better
-----------------
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down
Filling me up with your rules
I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can
I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine... 

Gimme Some Truth
-----------------
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight - short sighted - narrow minded hypocritics
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic - psychotic - pig headed politicians
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
No short haired - yellow bellied son of tricky dicky

With just a pocketful of hope
Money for dope -
Money for mope

From tight lipped - condescending - mommies little
Chauvinists
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
I've had enough of watching scenes
Of schizophrenic - ego - centric - paranoic - prima - donnas
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth

Girl
-----------------
Is there anybody going to listen to my story,
All about the girl who came to stay,
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry,
Still you son't regret a single day.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her,
She will turn to me and start to cry,
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her,
After all this time I don't know why.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
She's the kind of girl who puts you down,
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
(Tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu)
When you say she's looking good,
She acts as if it's understood,
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasu-re,
Did she understand it when they said,
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leasure,
Will she still believe it when he's dead.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) .....

Glass Onion
-----------------
I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go-wo
Where everything flow-ows,
Looking through the bent backed fulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the Walrus and me man,
You know that we're as close as can be, man.
Well here's another clue for you all,
The walrus was Paul
Standing on a castiron shore yeah.
Lady Madonna tryin' to make ends meet yeah,
Looking through a glass onion
Oh yeah - oh yeah - oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the Fool on the Hill,
I tell you man he's living there still
Well here's another place you can be,
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make dovetail joint yeah.
Looking through a glass onion.

God
-----------------
God is a concept
By which we measure
Our pain
I'll say it again
God is a concept
By which we measure
Our pain
I don't believe in magic
I don't believe in I-Ching
I don't believe in Bible
I don't believe in Tarot
I don't believe in Hitler
I don't believe in Jesus
I don't believe in Kennedy
I don't believe in Buddha
I don't believe in Mantra
I don't believe in Gita
I don't believe in yoga
I don't believe in kings
I don't believe in Elvis
I don't believe in Zimmerman
I don't believe in Beatles
I just believe in me
Yoko and me
And that's reality
The dream is over
What can I say?
The dream is over
Yesterday
I was the dreamweaver
But now I'm reborn
I was the walrus
But now I'm John
And so dear friends
You just have to carry on
The dream is over

Golden Slumbers
-----------------
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Good Day Sunshine
-----------------
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can blab about I feel good
In a special way, I'm in love and it's a sunny day.
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
And then we lie beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine.

Good Morning, Good Morning
-----------------
Good morning, good morning...
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And you're on your own you're in the street.
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing had changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life.
It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.
Go to show you hope she goes.
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...

Good Night
-----------------
Now it's time to say good night, good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light, good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine, good night sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine, good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you
Mm.....Mm.....Mm.....
Close your eyes and I'll close mine, good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light, good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you
good night, good night ev'rybody
Ev'rybody ev'rywhere good night

Goodbye
-----------------
Please don't wake me until late tomorrow comes
and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave to go away
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
Goodbye my love Goodbye
Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now
and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them
for the one who waits behind
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
Goodbye my love Goodbye
Do do do do do do do
do do do do
do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do

Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye

Far away my lover sings a lonely song
and calls me to his side
When the song of lonely love invites me on
I must go to his side
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye,
Goodbye my love Goodbye

No Reply
-----------------
This happened once before when I came through your door,
No Rep-ly
They said it wasn't you but I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know thet you saw me 'cos I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone they said you were not home that's a lie
'Cos I know where you've been I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cos you walked hand in hand with another man in my place
If I were you I'd realise that I love you more than any
other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I heard before
When you gave me no reply,
No Reply, No Reply...

I'm A Loser
-----------------
I'm A Loser, I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be.
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was the girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end.
I'm A Loser and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry
I'm A Loser and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it to late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all.
I'm A Loser and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be

Baby's In Black
-----------------
Oh dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue tell me, oh what can I do
She thinks of him and she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black.
Oh dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue. Tell me, oh what can I do
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim she thinks of him.
Oh how long will it take till she sees the mistake
She made? Dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue. Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black.
Oh dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue. Tell me, oh what can I do?

Rock And Roll Music
-----------------
Just let me hear some of that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me.
If you wanna dance with me.
I've got no kick against modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast;
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sound just like a symphony.
That's why I go for that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me.
If you wanna dance with me.
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks,
So she can hear my man a wail a sax;
I must admit they have a rockin' band,
Man, they were goin' like a hurrican'.
That's why I go for that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me.
'Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jokey folks they had a jamboree;
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' got all shook up.
And started playin' that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me.
If you wanna dance with me.
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to hear a mambo;
It's 'way too early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano.
So I can hear some of that Rock And...

I'll Follow The Sun
-----------------
One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come and so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend In the end you will know
Oh, One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun

Mr. Moonlight

You came to me one summernight and from your beam you made my dream,
And from the world you sent my girl and from above you sent us love,
And now she's mine.

Begging if you please, and the nights you don't come my way.

I Should Have Known Better
-----------------
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love ev'rything that you do
And I do, Hey hey hey, and I do, Whoa whoa
Never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you oh
You're gonna say you love me too, Hoo hoo hoo hoo Oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So oh, should have realised a lot of things before
If this is love you've gotta give me more
give me more, hey hey hey, give me more, Whoa whoa
You love me too, you love me too...

If I Fell
-----------------
If I fell in love with you would you promise to be true
And help me understand, 'cos I've been in love before
And I found that love was more than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you, I must be sure
From the very start that you would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please don't hurt my pride like her
'Cos I couldn't stand the pain and I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you and that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cos I couldn't stand the pain and I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you and that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you.

Tell Me Why
-----------------
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Well I gave you ev'rything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologise
If you don't I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cos I really can't stand it I'm
So in love with you
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me.

And I Love Her

And if you saw my love
You'd love her too

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long I have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Free As A Bird
-----------------
Free As A Bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, as a bird on wings
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly--a bird on wing
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Always made me feel soooo
Free
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird

Hallelujah, I Love Her So
-----------------
Let me tell you about a girl I know,
she's my baby and I love her so.
Every morning when the sun comes up,
she brings me coffee in my favorite cup.
That's why I know, yes I know,
hallelujah I just love her so.
When I call her on the telephone,
she says: baby, I'm all alone.
By the time I count from one to four,
she'll be knocking on my door.
In the evening when the sun goes down
and there ain't nobody else around,
she kisses me and she holds me tight.
She says: baby everything is alright.
That's why I know, that's why I know
hallelujah I just love her so.
hallelujah I just love her so,
hallelujah I just love that chick so.

Happiness Is A Warm Gun
-----------------
She's not a girl who misses much,
Do do do do do do do Oh yeah
She's well aquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hob-nail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working over-time
A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits I left up town
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Mother Superior jump the gun - Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun - Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun - Mother Superior jump the gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no-one can do me no harm because:
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun!

Hard Times Are Over
-----------------
It's been very hard,
But it's getting easier now,
Hard times are over, over for a while,
The leaves are shining in the sun,
And smiling inside,
You and I watching each other on a street corner,
Cars and buses and planes and people go by,
But we don't care,
We want to know,
We want to know in each other's eyes,
That hard times are over, over for sometime,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over, over for a while,
It's been very rough,
But it's getting easier now,
Hard times are over, over for a while,
The streams are twinkling in the sun,
And I'm smiling inside,
You and I walking together 'round the street corner,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over, over for a while.

Lennon & McCartney
Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anubody
Help! You know I need someone
Help!
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way
And now these days have gone
I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh, so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like
I've never done before
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me?

Here Comes The Sun

Here There And Everywhere
-----------------
To lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there
I want her her ev'rywhere and if she's beside me I know I
need never care
But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere
Here there and everywhere

Hey Bulldog
-----------------
Sheep dog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile
Child like no-one understands
Jack-knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your ears
You can talk to me - You can talk to me
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened in the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me - You can talk to me
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey Bulldog - Hey Bulldog
Hey Bulldog - Hey Bulldog
Woof wha'd'ya say
I said Woof d'y'know any more
Wow-u-wa

Hey Jude
-----------------
Hey Jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain
Hey Jude refrain
don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Da da da da da da da da da
Hey Jude don't let me down
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude begin
you're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Da da da da da da da da da
Hey jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under yourskin
Then you'll begin to make it better,
better, better, better, better, better,
Oh, da da da da da da da Da da da da
Hey Jude
Da da da da da da Da da da da Hey Jude...

You gonna see the light

Really one
Well, you get things done

Honey Pie
-----------------
She was a working girl North of England way,
Now she's in the bigtime in the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy,
I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home.
Honey Pie, my position is tragic,
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.
You became a legend of the silver screen,
And now the thought of meeting makes me weak
in the knee.
Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic,
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey Pie, come back to me Oo
I like it like that Ooh ah.
I like this kind of hot kinds of music,
Hot kind of music, play it to me,
Play it to me, I got the blues.
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.
T-t-tee Now
Honey Pie, you're making me crazy,
I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home.
Come come back to me, Honey Pie
Ha - ha - ha Oo Ah Oo-oo Ah
Honey Pie, come back.

Honeymoon Song
-----------------
I never knew that a day
like today lay before us.
I've got the sun in my heart
and my heart's in the sun.
Skies are as bright
as your eyes,
the horizon is open.
Love is the ceiling,
feelings are reelings
free as the air.
Forever on and forever,
forever on side by side.
who ever knew that we two
could be free as we'd fancy,
fancy is free
but are we bound
to each other by love,
to each other by love?
Who ever knew that we two
could be free as we'd fancy,
fancy is free
but are we bound
to each other by love,
to each other by love,
to each other by love,
to each other by love?

I'd do it to you.
How do you do
what you do to me?
I'm feeling blue,
wish I knew how you do it to me
but I haven't a clue.
You give me a feeling in my heart,
like an arrow piercing through it.
I suppose that you think you're very smart,
but won't you tell me how do you do it?
How do you do

I Forgot to Remember to Forget
-----------------
I forgot to remember to forget her,
I can't seem to get her off my mind.
I thought I'd never miss her,
but I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time.
Well the day she went away
I made myself I promise
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met.
But something sure is wrong
'cos I'm so blue and lonely:
I forgot to remember to forget.

But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand.
Well you say that you need me
like an ocean needs sand.
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand.

more than anyone can.
But a one sided love
I just don't understand.
Well you know that I love you

I Need You
-----------------
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me I'm lonely as can be
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes, I need you
You told me, oh yes you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this
I just don't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you,
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you, I need you, I need you

I Want To Tell You
-----------------
I Want To Tell You, my head is filled with things to say
When you're here, all those words they seem to slip away
When I get near you, the games begin to drag me down
It's alright, I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind it's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things, I Want To Tell You
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait forever I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand, I Want To Tell You
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait forever I've got time
I've got time, I've got time...

-----------------
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely life time
If you want me to I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and ever
love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Ah you know I will I will
Mm mm Da da da da da da da

I don't want to see you again
-----------------
I don't wanna see you again.
I hear that love is planned,
How can I understand?
When someone says to me;
I don't wanna see you again.
Why do I cry at night?
Something wrong could be right.
I hear you say to me;
I don't wanna see you again.
As you turned your back on me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play at being broken-hearted.
I know that later on,
After love's been and gone,
I’ll still hear someone say;
I don't wanna see you again.
I hear that love is planned,
How can I understand?
When someone says to me;
I don't wanna see you again,
I don't wanna see you again,
I don't wanna see you again.

I'll Be Back
-----------------
You know
If you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
Cos I told you once before goodbye
That I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes I'm the one who wants you
oh... oh
You could have better things to do
Than to break my heart today
This time I would try to show
That I'm not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realise
That if I run away from you
Then you would want me to
That I got a big surprise
oh... oh
You could have better things to do
Than to break my heart today
This time I would try to show
That I'm not trying to pretend
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
oh... oh
You if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again

I'll Be On My Way
-----------------
The sun is fading away,
that's the end of the day.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way.
Just one kiss, then I'll go.
Don't hide the tears that don't show.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way...
...to where the winds don't blow
and golden rivers flow.
This way will I go.
They were right, I was wrong.
True love didn't last long.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way.
To where the winds don't blow
and golden rivers flow.
This way will I go.
They were right, I was wrong.
True love didn't last long.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey.
I'll be on my way, ooh.
I'll be on my way, ooh.
I'll be on my way.

I'll Cry Instead
-----------------
I've got ev'ry reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today but I can't
So I cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you say it somehow but I can't
So I cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away ay-hay
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can until then
I'll cry instead.

I'm Down
-----------------
You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cos you're laughing at me
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down
Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same old thing happen every day
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down
We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moar "Keep your hands to yourself"
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down

(I'm really down)
Oo-oo

I'm Happy Just To Dance With You

There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight

I'm Looking Through You
-----------------
I'm looking through you Where did you go
I thought I knew you What did I know
You don't look dif'rent But you have changed
I'm looking through you You're not the same
You're lips are moving I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing But the words aren't clear
You don't sound dif'rent I've learnt the game
I'm looking through you You're not the same
Why tell me why did you not treat me right
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing over night
You're thinking of me The same old way
You were above me But not today
The only diff'rence is you're down there
I'm looking through you And you're nowhere
Why tell me why did you not treat me right
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing over night
I'm looking through you Where did you go
I thought I knew you What did I know
You don't look dif'rent But you have changed
I'm looking through you You're not the same
Yeh, I tell you you've changed
I'm looking through you...

I'm Losing You
-----------------
Here in some stranger's room,
Late in the afternoon,
What am I doing here at all?
Ain't no doubt about it,
I'm losing you,
Somehow the wires have crossed,
Communication's lost,
Can't even get you on the telephone,
Just got to shout about it,
I'm losing you,
Here in the valley of indecision,
I don't know what to do,
I feel you sliping away,
I feel you sliping away,
I'm losing you,
I'm losing you,
You say your not getting enough,
But I remind you of all that bad stuff,
So waht the hell am I supposed to do?
Just put a bandaid on it?
And stop the bleeding now,
Stop the bleeding now,
I know I hurt you then,
But that was way back when,
And well, do you still have to carrey that cross?
Don't want to hear about it,
I'm losing you,
I'm losing you.

I'm Moving On
-----------------
Save your sweet talk for when you score,
Keep your monday kisses for your glass lady,
I want the truth and nothing more,
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony,
You didn't have to tell a white lie,
You know you scored me for life,
Don't stick your fingers in my pie,
You know I'll see through your jive,
I want the truth and nothing more,
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony,
When you were angry you had love in your eyes,
when you were sad you had a dream in your voice,
But now your giving me your window smile,
I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony.

I'm Only Sleeping
-----------------
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head
I'm still yawning when I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream (float up stream)
Please don't wake me no don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Ev'rybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind
I think they're crazy running ev'rywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away
and after all
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time lying there and staring at the ceiling
waiting for a sleeping feeling
Please don't wake me, no don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head
I'm still yawning when I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream (float up stream)
Please don't wake me no don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

I'm So Tired
-----------------
I'm so tired I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No no no
I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
You'd say that I'm putting you on
But it's no joke it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm so tired I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired
I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh he was such a stupid git
You'd say that I'm putting you on
But it's no joke it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you ev'rything
I've got for a little peace of mind

I've Just Seen A Face
-----------------
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met,
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world
To see we've met
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Falling - yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again
Falling - yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way and
I'd have never been aware but as it is I'll dream
Of her tonight
Falling - yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again
Falling - yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again
I have never known
The like of this I've been alone and i have missed
Things and kept out of sight for other girls
Wew never quite like this

Falling - yes I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again

If I Needed Someone
-----------------
If I needed someone to love,
you're the one that I'd be thinking of,
If I needed someone, if I had some more time to spend,
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend, if I needed someone.
Had you come some other day,
then it might not have been like this,
But you see now I'm too much in love.
Carve your number on my wall
and maybe you will get a call from me,
If I needed someone, Ah.... Ah..... Ah..... Ah....

If You've Got Trouble
-----------------
If you've got trouble,
then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried,
you can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad
with all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
and don't bring your troubles to me
I dont think it's funny
when you ask for money and things,
especially when you're standing there
wearing diamond and rings
You think I'm soft in the head
well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
when you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone,
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got trouble,
then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried,
you can't be as worried as me

and don't bring your troubles to me
Ah rock on Anybody
You better leave me alone,
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two

you can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad

Just cause your trouble
and don't bring your troubles to me

In My Life
-----------------
There are places I remember all my life,
Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone, and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you,
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more
In my life I'll love you more

In Spite Of All Danger

Isolation
-----------------
People say we got it made
Don't they know we're so afraid?
Isolation
We're afraid to be alone
Everybody got to have a home
Isolation
Just a boy and a little girl
Trying to change the whole wide world
Isolation
The world is just a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
Isolation
I don't expect you to understand
After you've caused so much pain
But then again, you're not to blame
You're just a human, a victim of the insane
We're afraid of everyone
Afraid of the sun
Isolation
The sun will never disappear
But the world may not have many years
Isolation

It's All Too Much
-----------------
It's all too much It's all too much
When I look in to your eyes
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
Floating down the stream of time
From life to life with me
Makes no diff'rence where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake so take a piece
but not too much
Sail me on silver sun
Where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm ev'rywhere and get me home for tea
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
The more I learn the less I know but what I do
is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
It's too much
Ah It's too much
You are too much Ah
We are dead Ah
Too much Too much
Too much-a...

It's Only Love
-----------------
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my when you sigh my my inside just dries
Butterflies why I am so shy when I'm beside you
It's only love and that is all why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Ev'ry night just the sight of you makes night-time bright
Very bright haven't I the right to make it up girl
It's only love and that is all why should I feel the way I do
It's only love and that is all But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you
loving you

It's for you
-----------------
I’d say some day,
I’m bound to give my heart away.
When I do,
It's for you.
Love, true love,
Seems to be all I’m thinking of.
But it's true;
It's for you.
They said that love was a lie,
Told me that I
Should never try to find
Somebody who'd be kind,
Kind to only me.
So I just tell them they're right,
Who wants to fight?
Tell them I quite agree,
Nobody’d love me,
Then I look at you.
And love comes, love shows,
I give my heart and no one knows
But I do.
It's for you.
It's for you.
They said that love was a lie,

Jealous guy
-----------------
i was dreaming of a past
and my heart was beating fast
i began to lose control
i began to lose control
i didn't mean to hurt

i didn't mean to hurt you
i'm just a jealous guy
i was feeling inscure
you might not love me anymore
i was shivering inside

i was trying to catch your eyes

hide
i was swallowing my pain
i was swallowing my pain

John Sinclair
-----------------
It ain’t fair, John Sinclair
In the stir of breathing air
Won’t you care for John Sinclair?
In the stair of breathing air.
Let him be, set him free
Let him be like you and me.
They give him ten for two
What else can the judges do?
Gotta, gotta.....gotta, set him free.
If he had been a soldier man
Shooting gooks in Vietnam
If he was the CIA
Selling dope and making hay
He’d be free, they’d let him be
Breatthing air, like you and me
They gave me ten for two
What more can the judges do?
Gotta, gotta....gottta set him freee.
Was he jailed for what he done?
Representing everyone
Free john now, if we can
From the clutches oof the man
Let him free, lift the lid
Bring him to his wife and kids.
They gave me ten for two
What more can the bastards do?
Gotta, gotta...gotta set him free...

Julia
-----------------
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you Julia
Julia Julia ocean child calls me
So I sing a song of love Julia
Julia seashell eyes winding smile calls me
So I sing a song of love Julia
Her hair of floating sky is
shimmering glimmering in the sun

So I sing a song of love Julia
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind Julia Julia
Sleeping sand silent cloud touch me
So I sing a song of love Julia

Calls me so I sing a song of love for Julia

When you mess with the girl I love,

Lady Madonna
-----------------
Lady Madonna children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creep in like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they'll run
Lady Madonna lying in the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wedn'sday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they'll run
Lady Madonna children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
 	
Leave My Kitten Alone

Lend me your comb,
it's time to go home.
I got to go past,

Your mammie will scold,

Unless we come in
the way we went out.
Kissing you was fun honey
but thanks for the date.
But I must come to run honey,
but you know baby it's getting late.
Just wait till I
say: my darling,

We got to go home.

Let It Be
-----------------
When I find myself in time of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
And when the broken
Hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance
That they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light
That shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Little Queenie
-----------------
I got the lumps in my throat
When I saw her coming down the isle
I get the wiggles in my knee
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeh she looks like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got a chance, I ought to take it
If she'll dance, we can make it
Come on Queenie, let's shake it
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
I said: go go go little Queenie
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
She's looking like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was still thinking,
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, that'll get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
Come on, Queenie, let's get with it
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeh she looks like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got a chance, I ought to take it
If she'll dance, we can make it
Come on Queenie, let's shake it
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie

Lovely Rita
-----------------
Lovely Rita meter maid, Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid,
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free to take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.

Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
-----------------
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmelade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds...

Maggie Mae
-----------------
Oh, dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she'll never walk down Lisle Street any mower
Oh, the judge he guilty found her of robbing the homeward boun-der

She returned me to two pound ten a week
That was my pay

Maxwell's Silver Hammer
-----------------
Joan was quizzical studied paraphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a testube oh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures Jo-oh ho-oan
But as she's getting ready to go a knock comes on the door
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Back in the school again Maxwell plays the fool again teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-ee-ee-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away so he waits behind
Writing fifty times I must not be so-oh-ho-oan
But when she turns her back on the boy he creeps up from behind
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
P.C. thirty one said we've caught a dirty one Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures oh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery say he must go free
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh ho-oan
But as the words are leaving his lips a noise comes from behind
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Silver hammer man.

Mean Mr. Mustard
-----------------
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park,
shaves in the dark trying to save paper.
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose,
such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in the shop
she never stops, she's a go getter.
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene,
such a Dirty old man,
Dirty old man.

Memphis, Tennessee
-----------------
Long distance information
give me Memphis Tennessee.
Try to find the party
trying to get in touch with me.
She could not leave her number
but I know who placed the call.
'Cos my uncle took the message
and he wrote it on the wall.
Help me, information,
more than that I cannot add.
Only that I miss her
and all the fun we had.
We were pulled apart
because her ma would not agree.
Help me get in touch with her
in Memphis Tennessee.
Last time I saw Marie
she was waving me goodbye,
with hurry homedrops on her cheek
that trickled from her eye.
Marie is only six years old,
information please.
Help me get in touch with her
in Memphis Tennessee.

Moonlight Bay
-----------------
We were strolling along (twist and shout!)
On Moonlight Bay (woo hoo!)
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
You said you'd stay
You have broken my heart (oh, twist and shout!)
So go away
With your short and hairy legs
On Moonlight Bay
On Moonlight Bay

Mother

Mother, you had me, but I never had you

So I, I just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

Daddy come home

Mother Nature's Son
-----------------
Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's Son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for ev'ryone
Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the sound of pretty music as she flies.
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Find me in a field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do yay yay yay
Mm mm mm ah wa-wa-wa
Mother Nature's Son...

So much pain

My mummy's dead

New York City
-----------------
Standing on the corner
Just me and yoko ono
We was waiting for jerry to land
Up come a man with the guitar
in his hand
Singing "have a marijuana if you can"
His name was Davis Peel
And we found that he was real
He sangs"The pope smokes
dope everyday"
Up come a police man shoved
us up the street
Singin, "power to the
people today!"
NYC...NYC...NYC
Que pasa Ny?...Que pasa NY?
Well we went to max’s
Kansas City
Got down the nitty gritty
With the Elephants Memory
Band
Laid something down
As the news spread around
About the Plastic Ono
Elephants Memory Band!
Well we played some funky
boogie
And laid some tutti frutti
Singing "Long tall sally’s
a man"
Up come a preachman trying to be a teacher
Singing "God’s a red herring in grag!"
NYC...NYC...NYC
Que pasa Ny?...Que pasa NY?
Well we did the Staten
Island Ferry
Making movies for the telly
Played the fillmore and
Apollo for freedom,
Tried to shake our image
Just a cycling through
the village
But found that we had left it
back in london.
Well nobody came to bug us,
hustle ud or shove us
so we decided to make it
our home
If the man wants to shove
us out
We gonna jump and shout
The Statue of Liberty said,
"come!"
NYC...NYC...NYC
Que pasa Ny?...Que pasa NY?
NYC down in the village
What a bad-ass city!
Que pasa Ny?...Que pasa NY?

Nobody I Know
-----------------
Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you than me.
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise,
ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,
When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise,
Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

Norwegian Wood (This bird has flown)
-----------------
I once had a girl or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room isn't it good
Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
It's time for bed
She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire isn't it good
Norwegian wood?

Not Guilty
-----------------
Not guilty
for getting in your way
while you're trying to steal the day.
Not guilty
and I'm not here for the rest,
I'm not trying to steal your vest.
I am not trying to be smart,
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry for your ageing head.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.
No use handing me a writ
while I'm trying to do my bit.
I don't expect to take your heart.
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry that you're underfed.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.
Not guilty
for looking like a freak,
making friends with every Sikh.
Not guilty
for leading you astray
on the road to Mandalay.
I won't upset the apple cart.
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry that you've been misled.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.

Nothin' Shakin' (But the Leaves on the Tree)
-----------------
I tried to find out
What love is all about
And every day
It sure lets out
I see my baby
I get week in my knees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
My pappie told me
There'd be times like these
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang
And go to rocking Joes
The cats are something
On the heels and toes
I grab my baby
Tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be
Such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spends my money
Then she plays me cool
I beg her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
The sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees, yeah
She's got a way
That makes me act like a fool
Spent my money
Then she plays me cool
I'm begging her for kisses
On my bended knees
Oh won't you give me
Some of your loving, baby
Please please please
Though I keep trying hard
To make her mine
One day the wind will blow
The sun will shine
Till that time
She puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart
And threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking
But the leaves on the tree

Nowhere Man
-----------------
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere man
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all?
Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man the world is at your command
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere man
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Octopus's Garden
-----------------
I'd like to be under the sea
in an Octopus's garden in the shade.
He's let us in, Knows where we've been,
in his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
an octopus's garden with me.
I'd like to be under the sea
in an octopus's garden in the shade.
We would be warm below the storm
in our little hideaway beneath the waves.
Resting our head on the sea bed
in an octopus's garden near a cave.
We would be sing and dance around
because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
in an octopus's garden in the shade.
We would shout and swim about
the coral that lies beneath the waves.
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what a joy for ev'ry girl and boy
knowing they're happy and they're safe.
We would be so happy, you and me,
No one there to tell us what to do,
I'd like to be under the sea
in an octopus's garden with you
in an octopus's garden with you
in an octopus's garden with you

Old Brown Shoe
-----------------
I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now,
when I'm with you
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see you smile replacing ev'ry thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now,
when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on ev'ry finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe some day
Who knows baby? You may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and I should get together
Who knows baby? You may comfort me.
I want that love of yours To miss that love something I'd hate
I'll make an early start I'm making sure that I'm not late
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue, Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now,
when I'm with you
Yes I'm so gald you came here, it won't be the same now,
when I'm with you.

One After 909
-----------------
My baby says she's trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm travelling on the One after Nine-O-Nine
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're only fooling around with me
I said move over once move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm travelling on the One after Nine-O-Nine
I've got my bag, run to the station

Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well I said I'm trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine

Only A Northern Song
-----------------
If you're list'ning to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not; he just wrote it like that
When you're list'ning late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are; they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there's no one there
		
Ooh! My Soul

Ooh! My soul.

Penina
-----------------
Penina, Penina,
Penina, one night.
I've been to aldebaran,
I had a good time there.
Then I came to Penina
And found good friends.
Penina, Penina,
Penina, one night.
Penina, Penina,
Penina, one night.
Drinking liquids, drinking music,
Time has come, fill my heart.
Beat the drums, take me home,
Help me, friends, free my soul.
Penina, Penina,
Penina, one night.
Penina, Penina,
Penina, one night.
Time has come, time has gone,
Time to bed, forgive me, friends.
Take my arm, girl, let's go home,
Thank you all, left on board.
Penina, Penina,
Penina, one night.
Penina, Penina,
Penina, one night.
Penina,
Penina,

Penny Lane
-----------------
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go stop and say "Hello"
On the corner is a banker with a motor car
the little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mack in the pouring rain
Very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
in Penny Lane there is fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket in a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean it's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A full of fish and finger pies
in summer meanwhile back
behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
the pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play she is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane

Piggies
-----------------
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their styes with all their backing
they don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
what they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
	
Polythene Pam
-----------------
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in grag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeh yeh yeh
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's a killer diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the News of the world
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeh yeh yeh

Rain
-----------------
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes,
If the rain comes
When the sun shines they slip in to the shade (When the sun shi-nes)
And sip their lemonade (When the sun shines)
When the sun shines,
When the sun shines
Rain, I don't mind shine.
The weather's fine
I can show you that when it starts to rain (When the rain comes)
Ev'rything's the same
I can show you,
I can show you
Rain, I don't mind shine.
The weather's fine
Can you hear me that when it rains and shines
It's just a state of mind
Can you hear me,
Can you hear me

Real Love
-----------------
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
Thought I'd been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
Yes it's real, yes it's real love
It's real, yes it's real love...

Red Sails In The Sunset
-----------------
Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me
She sailed at the dawning
Oh way out and blue
Red sails in the sunset
I'm counting on you
Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me
Sweet wind we must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We'll marry tomorrow
And you'll go sailing no more
Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me
Sweet wind we must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We'll marry tomorrow
And she'll go sailing no more
Red sails at the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me

Remember
-----------------
Remember when you were young?
How the hero was never hung
Always got away
Remember how the man
Used to leave you empty handed?
Always, always let you down
If you ever change your mind
About leaving it all behind
Remember, remember, today
And don't feel sorry
The way it's gone
And don't you worry
'Bout what you've done
Just remember when you were small
How people seemed so tall
Always had their way
Do you remember your Ma and Pa
Just wishing for movie stardom
Always, always playing a part
If you ever feel so sad
And the whole world is driving you mad
Remember, remember, today
And don't feel sorry
'Bout the way it's gone
And don't you worry
'Bout what you've done
No, no, remember, remember
The fifth of November

Reminiscing
-----------------
I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby
Oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore
Well I think of all the lies you told
You're a junkman, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love
And as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of

Revolution
-----------------
You say you want a revolution
Well you know we all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know we all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright alright
You say you got a real solution
Well you know we'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know we're doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright alright
You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know we all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know you better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright alright
Alright alright alright alright
alright alright alright alright

Rocky Raccoon
-----------------
Now somewhere in the Black Mountain hills of Dakota
the-re lives a young boy named Rocky Raccoon-a
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that, he said I'm gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon-a
A Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she call'd her self Lil
But ev'ryone knew Her as Nancy
Now She and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said 'Danny boy, this is a show-down
But Daniel was hot he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
(Do) d' do d' do d' do do
do do d' do d' do d' do do
do do d' do d' do d' do do
do d' d' do d' d' do d'
do do do d' do do do do
(Do) d' do d' do d' do do
do do d' do d' do d' do do
do do d' do d' do d' do do
do d' d' do d' d' do d'
do do do d' do do do
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said "Rocky you met your match"
And Rocky said "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better Doc,
As soon as I'm able"
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival.
That's the story of Rocky Rac-coon

She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
-----------------
Oh Look out
She came in through the bathroom window
protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
by the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her
Didn't anybody see
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
she worked fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
well I knew but I could not say
And so I quit the police department
and got my self a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
she could steal but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her
Didn't anybody see
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me
Oh Yeah

She Said She Said
-----------------
She said I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said you don't understand what I said
I said No no no you're wrong
when I was a boy ev'rything was right ev'rything was right
I said even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cos you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said you don't understand what I said
I said No no no you're wrong
when I was a boy ev'rything was right ev'rything was right
I said even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cos you're making me feel like I've never been born
She said (She said)
I know what it's like to be dead (I know what it's like to be dead)
I know what it is to be sad (I know what it is to be sad)...

She's Leaving Home
-----------------
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Steppping outside she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy, our baby's gone
Why could she treat us so thoughtlessly
Why could she do this to me
She (We never thought for ourselves)
is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do was wrong)
is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside was laways denied
For so many years. Bye, bye
She's leaving home bye, bye

Sheila
-----------------
Sweet little Sheila
You know I can see her
Blue eyes and a pony tail
Cheeks are rosie
She looks a little nosey
Man, this little girl is mine
Never knew a girl
Like little Sheila
Her name drives me insane
Sweet little girl
That's my little Sheila
Man, this little girl is fine
Me and Sheila go for ever
Oh oh I'm feeling funny inside
When little Sheila
Whispers in my ear
Oh oh oh I love you Sheila dear
Sheila says she loves me
She says never leaves me
True love will never die
We're so doggone happy
Just me and Sheila together

Shot of Rhythm and Blues
-----------------
Well, if your hands start a-clappin'
And your fingers start a-poppin'
And your feet start a-movin' around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around
You get a shot of rhythm and blues.
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure.
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon!

Something in her style that shows me.
I don't want to leave her now,
You know I believe and how.
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know

Sunday Bloody Sunday
-----------------
Well it was sunday
bloody sunday
When they shot the people there
The crys of thirteen marty martyrs
Filled the free derry air.
Is there any one among you
Dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was
bleeding
When they nailed the
coffin lidds!
Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday’s the day!
You claim to be majority
Well you know that it’s a lie
You’re really a minority
Oh this sweet emerald asle.
When Stormont bans
our marchers
They’ve got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It’s those mother’s turn
to burn!
Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday’s the day!
You anglo pigs and scotties
Sent to colonize the north
You wave your bloody
Union Jacks
And you know what it’s worth!
How dare you hold on to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep ireland for the irish
Put the english back to sea!
Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday’s the day!
Yes it’s always bloody sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls and roads free forever
From the bloody english hands
Repatriate to britain
All of you who call it home
Leave ireland to the irish
Not for London or for Rome!
Sunday bloody sunday
Bloody sunday’s the day!

No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown!
Two left feet but oh, so sweet Georgia Brown!
They all sigh and wanna die for sweet Georgia Brown!
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie - - not much!
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came why it's a shame how she cools 'em down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met!
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her - - Sweet Georgia Brown!

They're really rocking in Boston,
in Philadelphia PA,
deep in the heart of Texas,
on down the Frisco Bay.
All over Saint Louis
and down in New Orleans.
All the cats want to dance with
sweet little sixteen.
Sweet little sixteen,
she's just got to have
about half a million
framed autopraphs.
Her wall is filled with pictures,
she gets them one by one.
Becomes so excited,
oh watch her at the run boy.
Oh mommy mommy,
please may I go.
You know it's such a sight to see
somebody steal the show.
Oh daddy daddy,
I beg of you.
Please say it to mommy
it's alright with you.
Sweet little sixteen
she's got the grown up blues.
Tight dresses and lipstick,
she's sporting in high heeled boots.
Oh but tomorrow morning
she'll have to change her trend
become sweet sixteen
and back in class again.
They're really rocking in Boston,
in Philadelphia PA,
deep in the heart of Texas
and down the Frisco Bay.
All over Saint Louis,
on down in New Orleans.
All the cats want to dance with
sweet little sixteen.

Take Good Care Of My Baby
-----------------
My tears are falling
'Cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There something that I got to say
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint rainbows all around her
Don't let her see the cloudy sky
Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you
So take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby

That means a lot
-----------------
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot.
And you know that your love is all you've got.
At times things are so bad,
And at times they're not.
But when she says she loves you,
That means a lot.
A friend says that a love is never true.
And you know that this could apply to you.
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got.
But when she says she loves you,
That means a lot.
Mm, love can be deep inside,
Love can be suicide.
Can't you see, you can't hide,
What you feel when it's real.
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot.
And you know that your love is all you've got.
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got.
But when she says she loves you,
That means a lot.
Can't you see?
When she says she loves you,
That means a lot.
Can't you see, yeah?
When she says she loves you,
That means a lot.

The Ballad Of John And Yoko
-----------------
Standing on the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said you've got to go back
You know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
They way of things are going
They're going to crusify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honey mooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say, you can make it O.K.
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
They way of things are going
They're going to crusify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed
I said we're only trying to get us some peace
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
They way of things are going
They're going to crusify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul - Think!
Made a lighting trip to Vienna
Eating choclate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, she's gone to his head
They look just two Gurus in drag
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
They way of things are going
They're going to crusify me.
Caught the early plan back to London,
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said we wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
They way of things are going
They're going to crusify me.
They way of things are going They're going to crusify me.

The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill
-----------------
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom.
He's the all American bullet headed Saxon mother's son.
All the children sing:
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephnats were taken by surprise,
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing:
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin,
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mother butted in.
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing:
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?
Hey Bungalow Bill what did you kill Bungalow Bill?

The End
-----------------
Oh Yeah alright
are you gonna be in my dreams
tonight.
And in the end the love you take
is equal to the love you make
Ah.

The Fool On The Hill
-----------------
Day after day alone on a hill, the man with a foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool as he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud, the man of a thousand voices talking perfect-ly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make and he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
And nobody seems to like him they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings but the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
He never listens to them He know that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.

The Inner Light
-----------------
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels the less one knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Without going out of my door
You can know all things on earth
Without looking out of your window
You can know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels the less one knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking

The Long And Winding Road
-----------------
The long and winding road
that leads to your door will never disappear,
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here,
lead me to your door
The wild and windy night
that the rain washed away has left a pool of tears
crying for the day,
Why leave me standing here,
let me know the way.
Many times I've been alone and manytimes I've cried,
Anyway you'll never know the manyways I've tried
but still they lead me back
to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here,
lead me to your door
Da da da da.
	
The Luck of the Irish
-----------------
If you have the luck of
the irish,
You’d be sorry and wish you
were dead
You shold have the luck of
the irish
And you’d wish you was
English instead!
A thousand years of torture
and hunger
Drove the people away from
their land,
A land full of beutty and wonder
Was raped by the british
brigands! Goddman!
Goddman!
If you could keep voices
like flowers
There’d be aharmock all over
the world.
If you could drink dreams
like the irish streams
Then the world would be high
as the mountain of morn
In the Pool they told us
the story
How the english divided
the land,
Of the pain, the death and
the glory
And the poets of auld
Eireland
If we could make chains with
the morning dew
The world would be like
galeway Bay
Let’s walk over rainbows
like leprechauns
The world would beone big
Blarney stone
Why the hell are the English
there anyway?
As they kill with god on
their side!
Blame it all on the kids and
the IRA!
As the bastards commit genocide
Aye! Aye!
Genocide!
If you had the luck of
the irish
You should have the luck of
the irish
You’d be sorry and wish you
were dead
And you’s wish you were
english instead!
Yes you’d wish you was
english instead!!
