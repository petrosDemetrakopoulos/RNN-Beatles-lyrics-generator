A Day In The Life
-----------------
I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights have changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on.
Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged my comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my way coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on.

A world without love
-----------------
Please lock me away,
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
Birds sing out of tune
And rainclouds hide the moon.
I’m okay, here I’ll stay with my loneliness
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
So I wait and in a while,
I will see my true love smile.
She may come, I know not when,
When she does I’ll know.
So baby, until then, lock me away,
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
So I wait and in a while,
I will see my true love smile.
She may come, I know not when,
When she does I’ll know.
So baby, until then, lock me away,
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a world without love.

Across The Universe
-----------------
Words are flying out like endless rain into a papercup,
They slither while, they pass, they slip away across the
univer-se
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing and caressing me.
Jai Guru De va Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.
Jai Guru De va Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing through my open views inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, it calls me on and on across the universe.
Jai Guru De va Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai Guru De va Om...

Act Naturally
-----------------
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta so is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can plat the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
All I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can plat the part so well
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

And Your Bird Can Sing
-----------------
You tell me that you've got everything you want
and your bird can sing but you don't get me
You don't get me
When you prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction I'll be round - I'll be round
You say you've seen seven wonders
and your bird is green but you can't see me
You can't me
When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken I'll be round - I'll be round
Tell me that you've heard ev'ry sound there is
And your bird can swing but you can't hear me
You can't hear me.

Angela
-----------------
Angela, they put you in
prison
Angela, they shot down
your man
Angela, you`re one of the
millions of political
prisioners in the world.
Sister, there´s wind that
never dies
Sister, we´re breathing
together
Sister, our loves and hopes
forever keep
on moving oh so slowly
in the world.
Angela, can you hear the
earth is turning?
Angela, the world
watches you.
Angela, you soon will be
returning to your sisters and
brothers of the world.
Sister, you`re still a people
teacher
Sister, your word reaches far
Sister, there`s a million
different races but we all
share the same future
in the world.
They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but
the jailhouse key.
They gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything
but equality.

Another Girl
-----------------
For I have got Another Girl
Another girl you're naking me say
that I've got nobody but you
But as from today well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got Another Girl,
Another girl she's sweeter than all the girls
and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do

For I have got Another Girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you

Attica State
-----------------
Lennon & Yoko Ono
What a waste of human
power
What a waste of human lives,
shoot the prisioners in
the towers
Forthy-three poor widowed
wives
Media blames it on the
prisioners,
But the prisioners did not kill
"Rockefeller pulled the trigger"
That’s what the people feel.
Attica, Attica state, we’re all
mates with Attica state.
Free the prisioners, free
the judges
Free all the prisioners everywhere,
All they want is truth
and justice
All they need is love and care
They all live in suffocation,
Let’s not wathc them die
in sorrow,
Now’s the time for revolution,
Give them all chance to grow.
Attica state......
Come together join the movement,
Take a stand for human rights,
Fear and hatred clouds
our judgement,
Free us all from endless
night,
Attica state....
We are all mattes...
We all live in......
Attica, Attica, Attica state.

Baby You're A Rich Man
-----------------
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are what do you want to be
And have you traveled very far, far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
How often have you been there often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E happy to be that way
No that you've found another key what are you going to play
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
Baby you're a rich man Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too...

Back In The USSR
-----------------
Flew in from Miami Beach, B.O.A.C.
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the USSR.
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee - it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the US.. - Back in the US..
Back in the USSR.
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Ooh - Come on
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the USSR.
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Ooh
Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrad warm
I'm back in the USSR - Hey
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the USSR.
Oh - yeah

Bad Boy
-----------------
A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girl's hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Bad To Me
-----------------
If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be
Sad and lonely if they knew that
I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be
Softly sighin' if they heard from the breeze that you
Left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so,
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be
Sad and lonely 'cos they know that
I got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so,
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be
Sad and lonely 'cos they know that
I got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me

Badge
-----------------
Thinking 'bout the times you drove in my car,
Thinking that I might have drove it too far.
And I’m thinking 'bout the love that you laid on my table.
I told you not to wander 'round in the dark,
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park.
Then I told you 'bout "our kid", now he's married to mabel.
Yes, I told you that the life goes up and down,
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.
Oo - oo -
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Talking 'bout a girl that looks quite like you,
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.

Close your eyes,
Have no fear,
The monsters gone,
He's on the run and your daddy's here,
Beautiful,

Before you go to sleep,
Say a little prayer,
Every day in every way,

To see you to come of age,
But I guess we'll both,
Just have to be patient,

But in the meantime,
Before you cross the street,
Take my hand,
Life is just what happens to you,
While your busy making other plans,

You're a beautiful boy,

Your eyes have seen the world,
Though your only four years old,
And your tears are streaming,
Even when your smiling,
Please never be afraid to cry,
You're a beautiful boy,
With all your little ploys,
Your mind has changed the world,
And your now forty years old,
You got all you can carry,
And still somehow empty,
Don't ever be afraid to fly,
All you beautiful boys,
Creating multiple plays,
You like to fence in your world,
And settle down when you're old,
You can run from pole to pole,
And never scratch your soul,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back,
Don't be afraid to be afraid.

Because

Ah Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Ah love is old love is new
love is all love is you
Because the sky is blue it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue
Ah ah ah ah

Born in a Prision
-----------------
We are born in a prision,
raised in a prision
Send to a prision called school,
We cry in a prision,
We love in a prision,
We live in a prision,
like fools.
Wood becomes a flut when
it’s loved,
reach for your self and your
battered mates.
Mirror becomes a razor when
it’s broken,
Look in a mirror and see
your shattered fate.
We live with no reason,
Kicked around for no reason,
Thrown out without reason
like tools.
Work in a prision
And hate in aprision
And die in a prision
as a rule.
We live in a prision
Among judges and wardnes
And wait for no reason or use
We laugh in a prision,
Go through all four seasons
And die with no vision
or truth

Carol
-----------------
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day.
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out.
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout.
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride.
You take your car along
And you park it outside.
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am,
'Cos every time you're gonna drive,
You find the joint is jammed.
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day. Aw.
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play,
Hold tight, tap your foot,
Don't let it carry you away.
Don't let the heat overcome you
'Cos they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd.
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought.
I got my eyes on you baby,
'Cos you dance so good.

Cleanup Time
-----------------
Moonlight on the water,
Sun light on my face,
You and me together,
We are in our place,
The gods are in the heavens,
The angels treat us well,
The oracle has spoken,
We cast the (perfect) spell,
Now it begins - let it begin,
Cleanup Time,
(Show those mothers how to do it),
The queen is in the counting home,
Counting out the money,
The king is in the kitchen,
Making bread and honey,
No friends and yet no enemies,
Absolutely free,
No rats aboard the magic ship,
Of (perfect) harmony,
Now it begins,
Cleanup Time,
(Show those mothers how to do it),
However, far we travel,
Wherever we may roam,
The centre of the circle,
Will always be our home,
The gods are in the heavens,
The angels treat us well,
The oracle has spoken,
We cast the (perfect) spell.

Cold Turkey

Body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone.
My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm at the deep freeze.
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Thirty six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again
Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell
Cold turkey has got me on the run

And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving darling, I be true
All my loving
All my loving
All my loving I will send to you

Don't Bother Me
-----------------
Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same,
But I am to blame,
It's plain to see
So go away - leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe
That she would leave me on my own
It's just not right when ev'ry night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

Little Child

Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
Little child - Little child
Little child won't you dance with me

If you want someone to make you feel so fine,
Then we'll have some fun
When you're mine, all mine
So come on, come on, come on
Little child - Little child
Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
When you're by my side you're the only one
Don't you run and hide

Little child won't you dance with me
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me
Oh yeh - Baby take a chance with me

Till There was You
-----------------
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you

Roll Over Beethoven
-----------------
Well I'm awrite a little letter, gonna mail it to my local D.J.,
Yes it's a jumpin' little record I want my jockey to play;
Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today.
You know my temp'rature's risin' and the jukebox blowin' a fuse,
My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps asingin' the blues;
Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikowsky the news.
I got the rockin' pneumonia, I used a shot of rhythm and blues,
I caught the rollin' arthritis, sittin' down at a rhythm review;
Roll over Beethoven, they're rockin' in two by two.
Well, if you feel you like it, go get your lover,
The reel and rock it, roll it over,
Then move on up just a trifle further,
The reel and rock with one another, roll over Beethoven,
Dig these rhythm and blues.
Well, early in the mornin' and I'm givin' you my warnin',
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes;
Hey, diddle diddle, I'm a playin' my fiddle.
Ain't got nothin' to lose;
Roll over, Beethoven and tell Tchaikowsky the news.
You know she wiggles like a glow-worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top,
She got a crazy partner,
You oughta see 'em reel and rock;
Long as she's got a dime, the music won't ever stop.
Roll over, Beethoven, roll over Beethoven,
Roll over, Beethoven, roll over Beethoven,
Roll over, Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues.

Eleanor Rigby
-----------------
Ah, Look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church
Where a wedding has been Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door. Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from
All the lonely people, where do they all belong
Father Mckenzie, writing the words of a sermon
that no-one will hear No-one comes near.
Look at him working, darning his stocks in the night when
the-re's nobody there. What does he care?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from
All the lonely people, where do they all belong
Ah, Look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
and was buried a long with her name Nobody came.
Father Mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands
as he walks from the grave. No one was saved.
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
(Ah - Look at all the lonely people)
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
(Ah - Look at all the lonely people)

Every Man Has A Woman Who Loves Him
-----------------
Every man has a woman who loves him,
In rain or shine or life and death,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast,
Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I laugh when I feel like crying,
Every woman has a man who loves her,
Rise or fall of her life and death,
If she finds him in this life time,
She will know when she looks into his eyes,
Why do I roam when I know you're the one,
Why do I run when I feel like holding you,
Every man has a woman who loves him,
If he finds her in this lifetime,
He will know.

Fixing A Hole
-----------------
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the craks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

For No One
-----------------
Your day breaks Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
when she no longer needs you
She wakes up She makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you.
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
cried For No One
A love that should have lasted years.
You want her You need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says
her love is dead you think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
cried For No One
A love that should have lasted years.
You stay home She goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
she doesn't need him
Your day breaks Your mind aches
There will be times when all the things you said
will fill your head you won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
cried For No One
A love that should have lasted years.

For You Blue
-----------------
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do.
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living ev'ry moment, girl, for you.
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too.
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do.

From A Window
-----------------
Late yesterday night I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again your face came into sight.
I couldn't walk on until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine I knew you were the one.
Oh I would be glad just to have a love like that
Oh I would be true and I'd live my life for you
So meet me tonight just where the light shines from a window
And as I take your hand say you'll be mine tonight.
Oh I would be glad just to have a love like that
Oh I would be true and I'd live my life for you
So meet me tonight just where the light shines from a window
And as I take your hand say you'll be mine tonight.

Getting Better
-----------------
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down
Filling me up with your rules
I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can
I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine... 

Gimme Some Truth
-----------------
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight - short sighted - narrow minded hypocritics
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic - psychotic - pig headed politicians
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
No short haired - yellow bellied son of tricky dicky

With just a pocketful of hope
Money for dope -
Money for mope

From tight lipped - condescending - mommies little
Chauvinists
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
I've had enough of watching scenes
Of schizophrenic - ego - centric - paranoic - prima - donnas
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth

Girl
-----------------
Is there anybody going to listen to my story,
All about the girl who came to stay,
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry,
Still you son't regret a single day.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her,
She will turn to me and start to cry,
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her,
After all this time I don't know why.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
She's the kind of girl who puts you down,
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
(Tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu)
When you say she's looking good,
She acts as if it's understood,
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasu-re,
Did she understand it when they said,
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leasure,
Will she still believe it when he's dead.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) Girl, Girl.
Ah, Girl, (oothss) .....

Glass Onion
-----------------
I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go-wo
Where everything flow-ows,
Looking through the bent backed fulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the Walrus and me man,
You know that we're as close as can be, man.
Well here's another clue for you all,
The walrus was Paul
Standing on a castiron shore yeah.
Lady Madonna tryin' to make ends meet yeah,
Looking through a glass onion
Oh yeah - oh yeah - oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the Fool on the Hill,
I tell you man he's living there still
Well here's another place you can be,
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make dovetail joint yeah.
Looking through a glass onion.

God
-----------------
God is a concept
By which we measure
Our pain
I'll say it again
God is a concept
By which we measure
Our pain
I don't believe in magic
I don't believe in I-Ching
I don't believe in Bible
I don't believe in Tarot
I don't believe in Hitler
I don't believe in Jesus
I don't believe in Kennedy
I don't believe in Buddha
I don't believe in Mantra
I don't believe in Gita
I don't believe in yoga
I don't believe in kings
I don't believe in Elvis
I don't believe in Zimmerman
I don't believe in Beatles
I just believe in me
Yoko and me
And that's reality
The dream is over
What can I say?
The dream is over
Yesterday
I was the dreamweaver
But now I'm reborn
I was the walrus
But now I'm John
And so dear friends
You just have to carry on
The dream is over

Golden Slumbers
-----------------
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Good Day Sunshine
-----------------
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can blab about I feel good
In a special way, I'm in love and it's a sunny day.
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
And then we lie beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine,
Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine.

Good Morning, Good Morning
-----------------
Good morning, good morning...
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And you're on your own you're in the street.
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing had changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life.
It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.
Go to show you hope she goes.
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...

Good Night
-----------------
Now it's time to say good night, good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light, good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine, good night sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine, good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you
Mm.....Mm.....Mm.....
Close your eyes and I'll close mine, good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light, good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me, dream sweet dreams for you
good night, good night ev'rybody
Ev'rybody ev'rywhere good night

Goodbye
-----------------
Please don't wake me until late tomorrow comes
and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave to go away
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
Goodbye my love Goodbye
Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now
and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them
for the one who waits behind
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye
Goodbye my love Goodbye
Do do do do do do do
do do do do
do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do

Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye

Far away my lover sings a lonely song
and calls me to his side
When the song of lonely love invites me on
I must go to his side
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye,
Goodbye my love Goodbye

No Reply
-----------------
This happened once before when I came through your door,
No Rep-ly
They said it wasn't you but I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know thet you saw me 'cos I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone they said you were not home that's a lie
'Cos I know where you've been I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cos you walked hand in hand with another man in my place
If I were you I'd realise that I love you more than any
other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I heard before
When you gave me no reply,
No Reply, No Reply...

I'm A Loser
-----------------
I'm A Loser, I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be.
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was the girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end.
I'm A Loser and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry
I'm A Loser and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it to late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all.
I'm A Loser and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm A Loser and I'm not what I appear to be

Baby's In Black
-----------------
Oh dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue tell me, oh what can I do
She thinks of him and she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black.
Oh dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue. Tell me, oh what can I do
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim she thinks of him.
Oh how long will it take till she sees the mistake
She made? Dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue. Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black.
Oh dear what can I do Baby's in Black
And I'm feeling blue. Tell me, oh what can I do?

Rock And Roll Music
-----------------
Just let me hear some of that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me.
If you wanna dance with me.
I've got no kick against modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast;
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sound just like a symphony.
That's why I go for that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me.
If you wanna dance with me.
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks,
So she can hear my man a wail a sax;
I must admit they have a rockin' band,
Man, they were goin' like a hurrican'.
That's why I go for that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me. If you wanna dance with me.
'Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jokey folks they had a jamboree;
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' got all shook up.
And started playin' that Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock roll music,
If you wanna dance with me.
If you wanna dance with me.
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to hear a mambo;
It's 'way too early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano.
So I can hear some of that Rock And...

I'll Follow The Sun
-----------------
One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun
Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come and so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend In the end you will know
Oh, One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun

Mr. Moonlight

You came to me one summernight and from your beam you made my dream,
And from the world you sent my girl and from above you sent us love,
And now she's mine.

Begging if you please, and the nights you don't come my way.

I Should Have Known Better
-----------------
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love ev'rything that you do
And I do, Hey hey hey, and I do, Whoa whoa
Never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you oh
You're gonna say you love me too, Hoo hoo hoo hoo Oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So oh, should have realised a lot of things before
If this is love you've gotta give me more
give me more, hey hey hey, give me more, Whoa whoa
You love me too, you love me too...

If I Fell
-----------------
If I fell in love with you would you promise to be true
And help me understand, 'cos I've been in love before
And I found that love was more than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you, I must be sure
From the very start that you would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please don't hurt my pride like her
'Cos I couldn't stand the pain and I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you and that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cos I couldn't stand the pain and I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you and that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you.

Tell Me Why
-----------------
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Well I gave you ev'rything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologise
If you don't I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cos I really can't stand it I'm
So in love with you
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me
Tell Me Why, you cried and why you lied to me.

And I Love Her

And if you saw my love
You'd love her too

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long I have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Free As A Bird
-----------------
Free As A Bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, as a bird on wings
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly--a bird on wing
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Always made me feel soooo
Free
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird

Hallelujah, I Love Her So
-----------------
Let me tell you about a girl I know,
she's my baby and I love her so.
Every morning when the sun comes up,
she brings me coffee in my favorite cup.
That's why I know, yes I know,
hallelujah I just love her so.
When I call her on the telephone,
she says: baby, I'm all alone.
By the time I count from one to four,
she'll be knocking on my door.
In the evening when the sun goes down
and there ain't nobody else around,
she kisses me and she holds me tight.
She says: baby everything is alright.
That's why I know, that's why I know
hallelujah I just love her so.
hallelujah I just love her so,
hallelujah I just love that chick so.

Happiness Is A Warm Gun
-----------------
She's not a girl who misses much,
Do do do do do do do Oh yeah
She's well aquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hob-nail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working over-time
A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits I left up town
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Mother Superior jump the gun - Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun - Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun - Mother Superior jump the gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no-one can do me no harm because:
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun!

Hard Times Are Over
-----------------
It's been very hard,
But it's getting easier now,
Hard times are over, over for a while,
The leaves are shining in the sun,
And smiling inside,
You and I watching each other on a street corner,
Cars and buses and planes and people go by,
But we don't care,
We want to know,
We want to know in each other's eyes,
That hard times are over, over for sometime,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over, over for a while,
It's been very rough,
But it's getting easier now,
Hard times are over, over for a while,
The streams are twinkling in the sun,
And I'm smiling inside,
You and I walking together 'round the street corner,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over,
Hard times are over, over for a while.

Lennon & McCartney
Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anubody
Help! You know I need someone
Help!
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way
And now these days have gone
I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh, so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like
I've never done before
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me?

Here Comes The Sun

Here There And Everywhere
-----------------
To lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there
I want her her ev'rywhere and if she's beside me I know I
need never care
But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere
Here there and everywhere

Hey Bulldog
-----------------
Sheep dog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile
Child like no-one understands
Jack-knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your ears
You can talk to me - You can talk to me
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened in the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me - You can talk to me
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey Bulldog - Hey Bulldog
Hey Bulldog - Hey Bulldog
Woof wha'd'ya say
I said Woof d'y'know any more
Wow-u-wa

Hey Jude
-----------------
Hey Jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain
Hey Jude refrain
don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Da da da da da da da da da
Hey Jude don't let me down
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude begin
you're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Da da da da da da da da da
Hey jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under yourskin
Then you'll begin to make it better,
better, better, better, better, better,
Oh, da da da da da da da Da da da da
Hey Jude
Da da da da da da Da da da da Hey Jude...

You gonna see the light

Really one
Well, you get things done

Honey Pie
-----------------
She was a working girl North of England way,
Now she's in the bigtime in the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy,
I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home.
Honey Pie, my position is tragic,
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.
You became a legend of the silver screen,
And now the thought of meeting makes me weak
in the knee.
Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic,
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey Pie, come back to me Oo
I like it like that Ooh ah.
I like this kind of hot kinds of music,
Hot kind of music, play it to me,
Play it to me, I got the blues.
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.
T-t-tee Now
Honey Pie, you're making me crazy,
I'm in love but I'm lazy,
So won't you please come home.
Come come back to me, Honey Pie
Ha - ha - ha Oo Ah Oo-oo Ah
Honey Pie, come back.

Honeymoon Song
-----------------
I never knew that a day
like today lay before us.
I've got the sun in my heart
and my heart's in the sun.
Skies are as bright
as your eyes,
the horizon is open.
Love is the ceiling,
feelings are reelings
free as the air.
Forever on and forever,
forever on side by side.
who ever knew that we two
could be free as we'd fancy,
fancy is free
but are we bound
to each other by love,
to each other by love?
Who ever knew that we two
could be free as we'd fancy,
fancy is free
but are we bound
to each other by love,
to each other by love,
to each other by love,
to each other by love?

I'd do it to you.
How do you do
what you do to me?
I'm feeling blue,
wish I knew how you do it to me
but I haven't a clue.
You give me a feeling in my heart,
like an arrow piercing through it.
I suppose that you think you're very smart,
but won't you tell me how do you do it?
How do you do

I Forgot to Remember to Forget
-----------------
I forgot to remember to forget her,
I can't seem to get her off my mind.
I thought I'd never miss her,
but I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time.
Well the day she went away
I made myself I promise
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met.
But something sure is wrong
'cos I'm so blue and lonely:
I forgot to remember to forget.
Well the day she went away
I made myself I promise
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met.

Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you

Keep you occupied with pie in the sky
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes
I, I found out!

I seen religion from Jesus to Paul
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine No one can harm you, feel your own pain

I Just Don't Understand
-----------------
Well you call me your baby
when you're holding my hand,
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand.
Well you say that you need me
like an ocean needs sand.
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand.
Well you know that I love you
more than anyone can.
But a one sided love
I just don't understand.
Well you know that I love you
more than anyone can.
But a one sided love
I just don't understand.
Well you call me your baby
when you're holding my hand,
Oh how you can hurt me
I just can't understand.

 	
I Me Mine

All thru' the day

All thru' the night

Now they're frightened of leaving it,
ev'ryone's weaving it,
coming on strong all the time,
All thru' the day I me mine
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it,
ev'ryone's saying it,
flowing more freely than wine.
All thru' the day I me mine
I I me me mine I I me me mine

I Need You
-----------------
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me I'm lonely as can be
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes, I need you
You told me, oh yes you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this
I just don't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you,
So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you, I need you, I need you

I Want To Tell You
-----------------
I Want To Tell You, my head is filled with things to say
When you're here, all those words they seem to slip away
When I get near you, the games begin to drag me down
It's alright, I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind it's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things, I Want To Tell You
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait forever I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand, I Want To Tell You
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait forever I've got time
I've got time, I've got time...

I Will
-----------------
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely life time
If you want me to I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and ever
love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Ah you know I will I will
Mm mm Da da da da da da da

I don't want to see you again
-----------------
I don't wanna see you again.
I hear that love is planned,
How can I understand?
When someone says to me;
I don't wanna see you again.
Why do I cry at night?
Something wrong could be right.
I hear you say to me;
I don't wanna see you again.
As you turned your back on me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play at being broken-hearted.
I know that later on,
After love's been and gone,
I’ll still hear someone say;
I don't wanna see you again.
I hear that love is planned,
How can I understand?
When someone says to me;
I don't wanna see you again,
I don't wanna see you again,
I don't wanna see you again.

I'll Be Back
-----------------
You know
If you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
Cos I told you once before goodbye
That I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes I'm the one who wants you
oh... oh
You could have better things to do
Than to break my heart today
This time I would try to show
That I'm not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realise
That if I run away from you
Then you would want me to
That I got a big surprise
oh... oh
You could have better things to do
Than to break my heart today
This time I would try to show
That I'm not trying to pretend
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
oh... oh
You if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again

I'll Be On My Way
-----------------
The sun is fading away,
that's the end of the day.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way.
Just one kiss, then I'll go.
Don't hide the tears that don't show.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way...
...to where the winds don't blow
and golden rivers flow.
This way will I go.
They were right, I was wrong.
True love didn't last long.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way.
To where the winds don't blow
and golden rivers flow.
This way will I go.
They were right, I was wrong.
True love didn't last long.
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey.
I'll be on my way, ooh.
I'll be on my way, ooh.
I'll be on my way.

 	
I'll Cry Instead
-----------------
I've got ev'ry reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today but I can't
So I cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you say it somehow but I can't
So I cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away ay-hay
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can until then
I'll cry instead.
